# Practiced BootStrap today
## Day went most smoothly as compared to the other days of the week and strangely learning was also more compared to past days
#### First practiced basics of Boot Strap like container, jumbotron, panel construction, well and others
#### Later practiced grids in BootStrap too.
#### Finally i had many things move over to my index.html from past projects and tried to present them using newly learned concept. It ended haphazard but the practice received was good. Even used float to move the picture of the dog with in a panel box to move to the right. Using private style sheet overriding the bootstrap.css

## index.html contains many pages repeated with every pager messed with differently.
